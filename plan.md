# Email Signup Service Implementation Plan

## Phase 1: Foundation Setup (Week 1) ✓
**Objective:** Core infrastructure & essential components

- Spring Boot 3.x project with Gradle
- Core dependencies: Web, Data JPA, Validation, AWS SDK, Bucket4j
- Dockerfile + docker-compose.yml with PostgreSQL
- Subscriber entity, Flyway migrations, Testcontainers

## Phase 2: Core User Workflows (Week 2-3) ✓
**Objective:** Implement primary subscriber journeys

- Signup flow: POST /api/signup with validation, duplicate prevention, confirmation tokens, async email
- Confirmation system: GET /api/confirm, token validation/expiration, verified status, welcome email
- Security & input validation: Rate limiting (Bucket4j), XSS prevention, null safety, comprehensive validation

## Phase 3: Security & Validation (Week 4) ✓
**Objective:** Protect API and data integrity

- Rate limiting: 5 req/min per IP
- Input validation: Email, name, XSS
- Null safety: @NonNullApi, @NonNullFields
- AWS SES integration: Verified sender/recipient, sandbox mode support

## Phase 4: Admin & Reporting (Week 5) ⏳
**Objective:** Enable subscriber management

- Admin endpoints: GET/DELETE subscribers ✓
- Export system (future): CSV/JSON, async export, S3 integration

## Phase 5: Deployment & Automation (Week 6) ⏳
**Objective:** Production-ready pipeline

- CI/CD (future): GitHub Actions, container builds, Flyway checks
- AWS integration (future): API Gateway, CloudWatch alerts
- Compliance (future): GDPR, privacy policy

## Status
- ✅ Application is fully working: Docker Compose, PostgreSQL, Flyway, SES integration, API endpoints
- ✅ End-to-end signup and confirmation flow tested
- ✅ Admin management (list, delete) implemented and tested
- ✅ Troubleshooting and error handling documented
- ⏳ Ready for export/reporting features and production deployment

## Next Steps
- Implement export/reporting features (CSV/JSON, async, S3)
- Prepare for production deployment and compliance
- Monitor and enhance security as needed
